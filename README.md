# Pipex

**Pipex** is a basic implementation of a program that simulates the behavior of the `pipe` command in Unix systems. It uses pipes to connect the output of one command to the input of another, allowing the execution of commands in sequence with input and output redirection.

## Description

This project was developed to demonstrate the use of pipes and input/output redirection in Unix systems. It allows executing two commands in a pipeline, where the output of the first command is passed as input to the second command. The final result is written to an output file.
